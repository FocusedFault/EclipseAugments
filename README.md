# Eclipse Augments

These changes should keep the intended game's pace while ramping up difficulty.

Eclipse 1: Initial Difficulty +25%

Eclipse 2: Difficulty Scaling +25%

Eclipse 3: Fall Damage is doubled but not lethal

Eclipse 6: Bosses have a weaker version of adaptive armor (mithrix's AA goes up to 400, this goes up to 100)
