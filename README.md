# Eclipse Augments

These changes should keep the intended game's pace while ramping up difficulty.

Eclipse 1: Difficulty Scaling +25%

Eclipse 2: Director Credits +15% (stronger/more enemies)

Eclipse 3: Fall Damage is doubled (not lethal)

Eclipse 6: Bosses have adaptive armor (Mithrix's AA goes up to 400, this goes up to 125 since bosses have much higher HP)

### What is Adaptive Armor?

Adaptive armor is why Mithrix feels tankier than his actual HP value (Base/Level 1000/300 vs Beetle Queen 2100/630). When taking a hit, an armor value is calculated based on how strong the hit is (caps at 400 for Mithrix) and applied BEFORE actually taking the damage. AA also deteriorates so it doesn't just stay up at the cap but that doesn't mean you can wait it out since it changes on-hit.
